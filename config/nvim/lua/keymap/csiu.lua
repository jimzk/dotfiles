-- Some key are totally equal, like <Tab> and <C-i>, <Esc> and <C-[>.
-- If mapping one, the other is mapped as well.

-- Luckily, nvim support out-of-box solution CSI u to distinguish them.

-- To use CSIu mapping:
-- 1. Map two keys individually
local opts = { noremap = true }
vim.keymap.set("n", "<C-m>", "", opts) -- Need to map <Cr> as well
set("n", "<CR>", function()
  pcall(vim.cmd, [[exe "normal! \<C-]>"]])
end, { desc = "Go to tag / definition" })

-- 2. Enbable CSIu in your terminal or GUI. Most of them support CSIu, like iTerm2 and neovide.
